# azure-stream-analytics-session-windows

Little project to test the new session windows in Azure Stream Analytics: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/stream-analytics/reference/session-window-azure-stream-analytics

For comparison I have added a query that outputs tumbling windows. Those look correct.  
I defined a maxDuratin for the session windows and this does not seem to be respected.
